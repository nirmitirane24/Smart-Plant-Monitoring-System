# Smart-Plant-Monitoring-System
This project implements a smart plant monitoring system using Arduino Uno microcontroller and various sensors including color sensor, soil moisture sensor and humidity sensor. The system is designed to provide monitoring and feedback on the health and environment of plants, enabling users to optimize their care and ensure healthy growth.

# Features:
* Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors soil moisture, humidity, and temperature levels.
* Color Sensing: Detects the color of leaves for identifying plant health and nutrient deficiencies.
* Data Logging: Logs sensor data to enable analysis and trend identification over time.
* Customizable Alerts: Configurable alerts for critical conditions such as low moisture levels or extreme temperatures.
* User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for displaying sensor readings and system status.
  
 # Components:
* Arduino Uno microcontroller
* Color sensor (e.g., TCS3200)
* Soil moisture sensor (e.g., FC-28)
* Humidity sensor (e.g., DHT11 )
* Temperature sensor (e.g., DS18B20)
  
# Usage:
* Connect the sensors to the Arduino Uno following the provided schematics.
* Upload the Arduino sketch provided in this repository to the Arduino Uno.
* Power up the system and monitor the readings on the connected display or through the serial monitor.
* Customize thresholds and alerts as per your plant's requirements.
  
# Repository Contents:
* Arduino Sketch: Contains the code to be uploaded to the Arduino Uno.
* Schematics: Circuit diagrams illustrating the connections between Arduino and sensors.
* Documentation: Detailed documentation on system setup, usage, and customization.
